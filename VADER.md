[Valence aware dictionary for sentiment reasoning](https://pypi.org/project/vaderSentiment/)
It uses a list of lexical features (e.g. word) which are labeled as positive or negative according to their semantic orientation to calculate the text sentiment.   

Vader sentiment returns the probability of a given input sentence to be 

<font color = 'orange'>Positive, negative, and neutral.</font>

The main drawback with the rule-based approach for sentiment analysis is that the method only cares about individual words and completely ignores the context in which it is used.
