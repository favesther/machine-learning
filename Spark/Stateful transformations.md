In contrast, an aggregation operation like `count()` requires maintaining state to combine data across multiple rows. More specifically, any DataFrame operations involving grouping, joining, or aggregating are stateful transformations. While many of these operations are supported in Structured Streaming, a few combinations of them are not supported because it is either computationally hard or infeasible to compute them in an incremental manner.
