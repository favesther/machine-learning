The time-series graph helps to highlight the trend and behavior of the data over time for building a more reliable model. To understand these patterns, we should structure this data and breakdown into several factors. We use various components to break down this data. They are,

* Structural breaks: sudden change - affects the reliability of the results
* Trend
* Seasonality
* Cyclicity: repeats after some interval of time
* Noise: random fluctuation
* Level
