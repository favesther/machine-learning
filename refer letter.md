I'm a data engineer 
Xinyi is currently a data engineer working on a supply chain services project at T-Mobile. Xinyi has more than two years of hands-on data analysis and engineering experience. At T-Mobile, she builds ETL pipelines with structured streaming, delta lake, and delta live table. She showed acute insights and great perception during data processing. While she was building a new framework, she incorporates production data rather than following the in-design guidelines, successfully optimized an aged problem in the existed system. Thanks to her excel in reverse engineering to find solutions to the issues.

She is not only specialized in discernment, but her strong self-management skills also contribute to high performance. Her team members and supervisor got sick and was gone for one week. She continued to work cross-functionally with other teams, covered for her team members, and assigned tasks to herself to push the project forward.
