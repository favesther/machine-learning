Between how many distinct pairs of cities (indepdendent of flight direction) do direct flights operate?
* By "direct flight", we mean a flight with no intermediate stops.
* By "independent of flight direction", we mean that two cities such as ('Seattle WA', 'Boise ID')
* should be counted once even if there are both flights from Seattle to Boise and from Boise to Seattle.
* Consider both canceled and non-canceled flights.
* Name the output column num_connected_cities.
[Output relation cardinality: 1 row]

```sql
select count(*) as num_connected_cities
from (select distinct f1.origin_city, f1.dest_city
from Flights as f1
except select distinct f1.origin_city, f1.dest_city
from Flights as f2, Flights as f1
where (f1.origin_city=f2.dest_city and f1.dest_city=f2.origin_city) or (f2.dest_city=f1.origin_city and f1.carrier_id=f2.carrier_id and f1.flight_num=f2.flight_num)) F;
```
