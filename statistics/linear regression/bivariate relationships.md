bivariate relationships
* **Form** (e.g., linear, non-linear). For linear regression, our primary concern is whether the form is linear of non-linear.
* **Direction** (e.g., positive, negative): Does the two variables tend to move in the same direction?
	- Positive - when X goes up Y goes up, Negative: when X goes up, Y goes down (opposite direction).
* **Strength** (how much scatter/noise?): Do the points cluster together in a way that suggests close relationship? Or are they loosely organized?
* **Outliers**: Any points that donâ€™t fit the overall pattern or lie far away as outliers.
