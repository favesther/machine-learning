*  `tidy(model)` returns coefficient results in a dataframe
*  `augment(model)` returns observation level results in a dataframe
*  `glance(model)` returns model level results
	*  sigma in `glance` output is RSE (residual standard error) 


[[RSE]] = difference b/w a prediction and an observed response, i.e., how much the predictions are typically wrong by.
