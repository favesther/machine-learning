CORRELATION: STRENGTH OF A LINEAR RELATIONSHIP
Correlation, which always takes values between -1 and 1, describes the strength of the linear
relationship between two variables.

## why do we need both quantities
* Correlation can only be applicable to a bivariate quantity (single response and single explanatory variable, or simple linear regression)
* Regression is a much more generic framework.
