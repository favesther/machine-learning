$\bar{y}$ and $\bar x$ are the sample means.


for linear regression, the 95% [[confidence interval]] for $\beta_1$ :
$$\hat{\beta_1}\pm2\cdot SE(\hat{\beta_1})$$
which means there is approximately a 95% chance that the interval
$$[\hat{\beta_1}-2\cdot SE(\hat{\beta_1}),\hat{\beta_1}+2\cdot SE(\hat{\beta_1})]$$
will contain the true value of $\beta_1$
