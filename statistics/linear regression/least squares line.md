	* $$b_1=\frac{S_y}{S_x}R$$
	* where $R$ is the correlation between the two variables, and $S_x$ and $S_y$ are the sample standard deviations of the explanatory variable and response, respectively.
	
* If $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean of the explanatory variable and $\bar{y}$ is the sample mean of the vertical variable, then the point ($\bar{x}$; $\bar{y}$) is on the least squares line.
