> it represents a range of plausible values where we are likely to find the population parameter

condidence interval is the range where the population’s mean will land.
* CI narrows with increasing sample size because we can have a higher precision to estimate where the population’s mean will land.



### 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL FOR A PARAMETER
When the distribution of a point estimate qualifies for the Central Limit Theorem and therefore closely follows a normal distribution, we can construct a 95% confidence interval as
$$point\space estimate\pm1.96\times{SE}$$

In a normal distribution, 95% of the data is within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean.

Using this principle, we can construct a confidence interval that extends 1.96 std. errors from the sample proportion such that we are 95% confident that the interval captures the population proportion. 

$$\hat{p}=1.96\times{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}}$$

95% CI: We took many samples and built a 95% confidence interval from each, then
about 95% of those intervals would contain the true mean.
