## One-sample t-test
> test of whether the mean of a population has a value specified in a null hypothesis.

## Two-sample t-test (or 2 independent sample t-test)
> test of the null hypothesis that the means of two populations are equal, i.e., compare differences between 2 independent group means

Eg.: A study was done to compare job stress between 2 employee groups (support staff and administrative staff). Test whether there is any difference in the job stress between the 2 employee groups?
## Paired t-test: 
> test of the null hypothesis that the difference between two responses measured on the same statistical unit has a mean value of zero

Eg: A training on R-programming was conducted to improve studentsâ€™s performance in a data science course. Data were collected from selected sample both before and after the training program. Test the hypothesis that the training is effective in improving the students performance
