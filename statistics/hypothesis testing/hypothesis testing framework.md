> A framework for using a sample to test whether the mean of a population is on one side of a reference point.

### Intuitive setting:
$H_0$ (Null hypothesis): The claim that is not interesting
$H_a$ (Alternative hypothesis): The claim corresponding to the research questions

**The goal is to disprove the null hypothesis**

### Formal setting:
$H_0$ (Null hypothesis): The reference point we arbitrarily chose. Denote as Î¼0.
$H_a$ (Alternative hypothesis): The side of the reference point which we think contains the population mean

### Process
Step 1: Write the null and alternative hypotheses
Step 2: Set the significance level for p (typically 0.05 or 0.01) Collect Data
Step 3: Calculate the test statistic
Step 4: Decide whether or not to reject the null hypothesis by comparing test statistics to critical value.
Step 5: Interpret the results
