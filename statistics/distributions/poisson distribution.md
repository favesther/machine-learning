Suppose we are watching for events and the number of observed events follows a Poisson distribution
with rate $\lambda$. Then
$$P(observe-k-events) =\frac{\lambda^{k}e^{-\lambda}}{k!}$$
where k may take a value 0, 1, 2, and so on, and $k!$ represents k-factorial, as described on page 150. The letter $e\approx2.718$ is the base of the natural logarithm. The mean and standard deviation of this distribution are$\lambda$ and $\sqrt{\lambda}$, respectively.
