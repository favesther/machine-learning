EDA checklist:

1. **Formulate your question** → see “Characteristics of a good question”
2. **Read in your data** → Is it properly formatted? Perform cleanup activities
3. **Check the packaging** → Make sure there are the right number of rows & columns, formats, etc.
4. **Look at the top and bottom of data** → Confirm that all observations are there
5. **Check the “n”s** → Identify “landmark” values and to check expectations (number of states, etc.)
6. **Validate against an external data source** → Right order of magnitude, expected distribution, etc.
7. **Make a plot** → Checking and creating expectations about the shape of data and appropriate analyses
8. **Try an easy solution** → What is the simplest test for your question?
