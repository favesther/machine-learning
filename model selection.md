## Convolutional Neural Networks #CNN 
* Diagnose health diseases from medical scans
* Predict if a skin lesion is benign or malignant based on its characteristics (size, shape, color, etc)

## Recurrent neural network #RNN (text related)
* When you are working with time-series data or sequences (eg, audio recordings or text)

* Balance the load of electricity grids in varying demand cycles

## Gaussian mixture model
* Feature extraction from speech data for use in speech recognition systems
* Object tracking of multiple objects, where the number of mixture components and their means predict object locations at each frame in a video sequence.
