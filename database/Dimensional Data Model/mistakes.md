* **build massive data models**: -> more design faults

* **lack of purpose**: ask for clarity on the business purpose. There are always too much things that the business wants with limited amount of resources.

* **Inappropriate use of surrogate keys**: Surrogate key should not be used unnecessarily. Use surrogate key only when the natural key cannot serve the purpose of a primary key.

* **Unnecessary de-normalization**: Dont denormalize until and unless you have a solid &clear business reason to do so because de-normalization creates redundant data which is difficult to maintain.
